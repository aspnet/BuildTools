This tool contains build scripts, console tools, MSBuild targets, and other settings required to build ASP.NET Core.

#### KoreBuild commands

Previously repositories were runable in only one way, by doing `.\build.cmd`. KoreBuild commands allow you to take wider and more granular actions.

Command      | Purpose                                                          | Example
-------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|----------
install-tools| Installs dotnet, CLI and Shared runtimes.                        | .\run.ps1 install-tools
docker-build | Runs the build inside docker.                                    | .\run.ps1 docker-build {jessie\|winservercore} /t:SomeTarget /p:Parameters
default-build| Runs install-tools followed by msbuild (like build.cmd used to). | .\run.ps1 default-build /t:SomeTarget /p:Parameters
msbuild      | Runs the build normally.                                         | .\run.ps1 msbuild /t:SomeTarget /p:Parameters
upgrade deps | Upgrade the dependencies.props of this project.                  | .\run.ps1 upgrade deps
generate deps| Generate a dependencies.props for this project.                  | .\run.ps1 generate deps

### KoreBuild config

KoreBuild can be configured by adding a 'korebuild.json' file into the root folder of your repository.

Example:
```js
// NB: Don't actually use comments in JSON files. PowerShell's ConvertFrom-Json will throw an error.

{
  // add this for editor auto-completion :)
  "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aspnet/BuildTools/dev/tools/korebuild.schema.json",

  // specifies the channel used to update KoreBuild to new versions when you attempt to upgrade KoreBuild
  "channel": "dev",

  "toolsets": {
      // All toolsets listed in this section are treated as required toolsets

      "visualstudio": {
          // defaults to `true`
          "includePrerelease": false,

          // see https://aka.ms/vs/workloads
          "requiredWorkloads": [
            "Microsoft.VisualStudio.Component.VSSDK"
          ],

          // Default = no minimum version
          "minVersion": "15.4",

          // This tool is only required on Windows.
          "required": [ "windows" ]
      },

      "nodejs": {
        "required": true,
        "minVersion": "8.0"
      }
  }
}
```
